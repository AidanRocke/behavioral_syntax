Lab Reports:
************************

1. The software was written so researchers would simply have to load data and get results.
2. The results will be in the form of lab reports using the increasingly popular Jupyter notebook format. 

Discretization:
==============

1. Visualization of k template postures
2. Show distance between postures using MDS
3. R2 charts
4. most/least common n-grams for each environment

Comparison of environments:
==============
1. Get the state sequence for each file:
2. Plot the state probabilities for each posture for each environment
3. plot state densities over time(using a window)
4. add heat map of state densities over time


Bayesian Analysis:
==============
