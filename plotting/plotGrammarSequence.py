#   gExp     - an N by 1 list of rules.  It is the expanded
#              version of the input grammar obtained by applying the rules
#              encoded in the grammar.  It contains the progressively
#              expanded version of each of the rules in the grammar.  For
#              any given entry gExp{ii}{end} contains only terminal
#              symbols.

#   sampRate - The sampling rate for creating the arc.  If sample rate is
#              1, there will be the same number of points as the arc
#              diameter.  Setting sampRate less than 1 will give
#              proportionately fewer points.
