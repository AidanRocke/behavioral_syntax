# QUANTIZETS Reduce a multidimensional time series to a quantized
# representation using a set of representative posture centers.  Each time
# point in the time series is replaced by the index in postureCenters of
# the corresponding closest representative.
#
# Input
#   timeSeries    - a numFrames x numDimensions matrix
#   centers       - a matrix of cluster centers used to represent each
#                   frame of timeSeries
#   warpNum       - the maximum length of repeated values allowed in
#                   stateSequence. If warpNum were set to 4, then a
#                   sequence 'aaaabbbb' would become 'ab'.  If warpNum were
#                   set to 3 it would become 'aabb', if 2 'aabb'.
#                   warpNum == 1 corresponds to no warping.
#   flickThresh   - the threshold for considering a state change to be a
#                   noisy "flicker".  A state change A -> B -> A is
#                   considered a flicker if B lasts for flickThresh or
#                   fewer frames.  In this case, B will be set to A to
#                   remove the flicker.  flickThresh == 0 indicates no
#                   flicker removal.  N.B. Using flickThresh > 1 might not
#                   make sense in some circumstances.  For example, it
#                   probably doesn't make sense to set B to A in a sequence
#                   like XXXABBBAXXX.
#
# Output
#   stateSequence - A numStates by 2 matrix.  The first column is the 
#                   sequence of states defined by the binned values
#                   across the channels, the second column is the number of
#                   times that state appears in the discrete version of the
#                   time series before warping by warpNum.
#   distVec       - The numFrames by 1 vector with the distance between
#                   each element of timeSeries and its nearest neighbour in
#                   centers. N.B. distVec is the distance calculated BEFORE
#                   removing 'flickers'.
