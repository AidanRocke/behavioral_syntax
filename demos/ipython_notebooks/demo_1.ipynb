    "   This means that the skeletons in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ first have to be transformed into angles. \n",
    "2. Non-trivial(and positive) gain in R2(variance explained) between number of templates was used to determine when to    stop increasing the number of templates. i.e. the elbow method was used\n",
