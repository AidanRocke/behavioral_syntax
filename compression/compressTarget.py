def compressTarget(dataVec, grammar):

# COMPRESSTARGET uses a grammar derived from another sequence to compress a
# target data vector that was not used to derive the grammar.  It
# calculates the compressed version of the target vector as well as the
# number of occurances of each of the elements of the grammar.
#
# See also: compressSequenceNFast.m and expandGrammar.m
#
# Inputs
#   dataVec  - a row vector of numbers to be compressed
#   grammar  - a number of rules by 2 list. The first column has the
#              left hand side of each replacement rule while the second
#              column has the right hand side (so the first column lists
#              all non-terminals in the grammar).
#
# Output
#   matchN   - a vector of counts.  matchN(i) contains the count of the ith
#              element in grammar.
#   compVec  - the vector that has been compressed using grammar.  dataVec
#              can be recovered by applying the grammar rules in reverse.
