def compressTargetApprox(dataVec, grammar, distTable, thresh):
    
# COMPRESSTARGETAPPROX uses a grammar derived from another sequence to 
# compress a target data vector that was not used to derive the grammar. It
# calculates the compressed version of the target vector as well as the
# number of occurances of each of the elements of the grammar.
#
# See also: compressSequenceApprox.m
#
# Inputs
#   dataVec  - a numpy array of numbers to be compressed
#   grammar  - an N by 2 cell array. The first column has the
#              left hand side of each replacement rule while the second
#              column has the right hand side (so the first column lists
#              all non-terminals in the grammar).
#   distTable   - a 2-dimensional list of distances.  distTable[i][j] is the
#                distance between state i and state j.
#   thresh      - the distance threshold for calling matches.  Distances
#                 less than or equal to thresh are considered matches.
#                 N.B. this is the threshold PER MATCH, so for a 5-gram,
#                 the threshold will be 5*thresh
#
# Output
#   matchN   - a vector of counts.  matchN(i) contains the count of the ith
#              element in grammar.
#   meanDist - a vector indicating the mean distance between each grammar
#              rule and its approximate matches in compVec
#   stdDist  - a vector indicating the standard deviation of the distances
#              between each grammar rule and its matches in compVec
#   compVec  - the vector that has been compressed using grammar.  dataVec
#              can be recovered by applying the grammar rules in reverse.
