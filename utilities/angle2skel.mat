def angle2skel(angleArray, meanAngle, arclength):

# ANGLE2SKEL Take in an angle array and integrate over the angles to get
# back a skeleton for each frame.  NB: This reconstruction assumes each 
# segment was equally spaced so that each reconstructed skeleton segment 
# has length arclength/(numAngles + 1)
# 
# Input
#   angleArray - a numSkelPoints - 1 by numFrames array of skeleton
#                tangent angles that have been rotated to have a mean
#                angle of zero.
#   meanAngle  - a 1 by numFrames array of angles.  Each angle is the mean
#                angle of the skeleton used to make the corresponding row
#                of angles in angleArray.  Can be left as zeros if no
#                rotation is desired.
#   arclength  - the total arclength of the skeleton to be reconstructed.
#                Can be set to 1 for a normalised skeleton.
# 
# Output
#   skelX      - a numAngles + 1 by numFrames array of skeleton
#                x-coordinates
#   skelY      - a numAngles + 1 by numFrames array of skeleton
#                y-coordinates
