# fdr_bh() - Executes the Benjamini & Hochberg (1995) and the Benjamini &
#            Yekutieli (2001) procedure for controlling the false discovery 
#            rate (FDR) of a family of hypothesis tests. FDR is the expected
#            proportion of rejected hypotheses that are mistakenly rejected 
#            (i.e., the null hypothesis is actually true for those tests). 
#            FDR is a somewhat less conservative/more powerful method for 
#            correcting for multiple comparisons than procedures like Bonferroni
#            correction that provide strong control of the family-wise
#            error rate (i.e., the probability that one or more null
#            hypotheses are mistakenly rejected).
#
# Usage:
#  >> [h, crit_p, adj_p]=fdr_bh(pvals,q,method,report);
#
# Required Input:
#   pvals - A vector or matrix (two dimensions or more) containing the
#           p-value of each individual test in a family of tests.
#
# Optional Inputs:
#   q       - The desired false discovery rate. {default: 0.05}
#   method  - ['pdep' or 'dep'] If 'pdep,' the original Bejnamini & Hochberg
#             FDR procedure is used, which is guaranteed to be accurate if
#             the individual tests are independent or positively dependent
#             (e.g., Gaussian variables that are positively correlated or
#             independent).  If 'dep,' the FDR procedure
#             described in Benjamini & Yekutieli (2001) that is guaranteed
#             to be accurate for any test dependency structure (e.g.,
#             Gaussian variables with any covariance matrix) is used. 'dep'
#             is always appropriate to use but is less powerful than 'pdep.'
#             {default: 'pdep'}
#   report  - ['yes' or 'no'] If 'yes', a brief summary of FDR results are
#             output to the MATLAB command line {default: 'no'}
#
#
# Outputs:
#   h       - A binary vector or matrix of the same size as the input "pvals."
#             If the ith element of h is 1, then the test that produced the 
#             ith p-value in pvals is significant (i.e., the null hypothesis
#             of the test is rejected).
#   crit_p  - All uncorrected p-values less than or equal to crit_p are 
#             significant (i.e., their null hypotheses are rejected).  If 
#             no p-values are significant, crit_p=0.
#   adj_p   - All adjusted p-values less than or equal to q are significant
#             (i.e., their null hypotheses are rejected). Note, adjusted 
#             p-values can be greater than 1.
