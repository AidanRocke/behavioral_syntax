# Input
#   mat1,2 - Two matrices with the same number of columns.
# 
# Output
#   Rmat   - A matrix of correlation coefficients.  Rmat(i, j) is the
#            correlation coefficient between the ith row of mat1 and the
#            jth row of mat2.  Rmat has dimensions size(mat1, 1) by
#            size(mat2, 1).
